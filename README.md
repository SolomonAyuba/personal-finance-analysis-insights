# Personal Finance Dashboard: 
**Tracking Spending, Savings & Financial Health Over Time**

---

## 📝 Overview  
I developed an **interactive Excel dashboard** to analyze and visualize **five years of personal financial data (2020–2025)**, uncovering key insights about spending behavior, savings patterns, and income trends.  
Using **Excel** and **Power Query**, I cleaned and transformed over **30,000 transaction records**, mapped categories, and built measures to track and compare financial performance over time.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation  
Data preparation was done in **Power Query** and included:  
- Formatting date and time fields  
- Separating Credit and Debit transactions  
- Removing duplicates using Transaction Reference  
- Creating a **Category Map** (Keyword → SubCategory → Category → Category Type)  
- Calculating total income, expenses, and savings trends

## 📊 Exploratory Analysis & Dashboard Design  

The dashboard was built around two main views:  

### 1️⃣ **Executive Overview**  
A summary of overall financial health showing:  
- **Income vs. Expense Trends**  
- **Savings Over Time**  
- **Top Expense Categories**  
- Category-level KPIs for Living Expenses, Transport, Savings, Salary, and Discretionary  

### 2️⃣ **Detailed Expense Dashboard**  
A breakdown by subcategory, displaying:  
- Monthly and yearly spending  
- Percentage contribution to total expenses  
- Categories with the highest spikes or unusual transactions
